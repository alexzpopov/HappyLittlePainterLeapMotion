# Download
- PC/Windows version : http://itch.io/jam/leapmotion3djam/rate/42579
- Added Mac & Linux builds also, not tested

# FAQ
- Can I use multiple brushes (tools)? : Not supported in this version (it works, but will have issues on the drawing)
- I have a feature request / bug report.. : Feel free to post them as [issues](https://github.com/unitycoder/HappyLittlePainterLeapMotion/issues) in this repository
- Does this work with Mac or Linux? : Both builds are included, but I have not tested them..

# Future Plans
- Optional: Use hand tracking instead of tool tracking (and brush is in the hand)
- Add different brushes & painting knives
- Add wet canvas simulation (mixing colors)
- Add brush pressure force (less force = less paint applier)
- Add more colors to palette
- Add proper color mixing in palette
- Oculus VR version
- Optional: Lock palette into left hand
- Add support for multiple simultaneous brushes
- Optional: Display color names on selection
